# Well Seasoned — project state & operating notes

Film & TV rating site built for Black culture. Dual score: **The Kitchen**
(verified critics) + **The Table** (community vote); the seal lands only when
both agree. Founding principle: **nothing fake** — no fabricated scores,
reviews, or votes, ever.

## Stack
- `index.html` — the entire app (single file, inline CSS + ES5 JS, no build).
  Hash-routed SPA (`#/view/arg`). Deployed on Vercel; pushes to
  `claude/new-session-9aa459` (the default branch) auto-deploy to
  https://itswellseasoned.com.
- `api/showtimes.js` — Vercel serverless SerpApi proxy (env `SERPAPI_KEY`).
- Supabase project `iherwgeuxwpapjreoofq` — Postgres + RLS + GoTrue auth.
  `backend/schema.sql` documents the schema (live changes went in as MCP
  migrations; keep the file in parity). Publishable key in the client is
  public by design; RLS is the enforcement layer.
- TMDB for posters/backdrops/cast/now-playing.
- Cloudflare Turnstile (invisible) on all GoTrue calls; Supabase Attack
  Protection CAPTCHA is ON — tokenless auth calls fail with `captcha_failed`.

## Launch checklist state (2026-07-03)
Done and verified live:
- Real auth (email+password, auto-confirm trigger) + silent anonymous
  identities for voting (`ensureIdentity`).
- Vote integrity phases 1+2: votes/comments require `user_id = auth.uid()`,
  one vote per identity, forged ids rejected, legacy null rows claimable.
- Vote integrity phase 3 (2026-07-03): `votes` re-keyed on IDENTITY. It was
  the last table still keyed on `(film_slug, device_id)` with a tangled
  two-generation policy set split across `{anon}`/`{public}` roles. Silent
  anonymous identities run as Postgres role `authenticated`, so the `{anon}`
  policies never applied to real voters, and the shared device row 403'd every
  upsert the moment a voter's identity changed (guest→real account, or a
  rotated anon identity) — the "every vote says can't save" bug. Fix: unique
  key is now `(film_slug, user_id)`, client upserts
  `on_conflict=film_slug,user_id` (an upsert only ever touches the caller's
  OWN row); `device_id` reverted `uuid`→`text` (nullable, metadata only —
  stops 400s on non-uuid fallback ids); one clean `{public}` policy set
  mirroring `person_votes`/`excitement_votes` (read-all, insert/update gated
  on `user_id=auth.uid()`, owner delete). All 105 rows preserved; forge +
  guest→signin re-vote verified in RLS. NOTE: `person_votes` still carries the
  same latent device-keyed 403 (harmless so far) — re-key it the same way if
  it ever surfaces.
- Invisible CAPTCHA wired client-side (`captchaToken`/`withCaptcha`) and
  enforced server-side (Turnstile site key in `TURNSTILE_KEY`; Supabase
  Attack Protection CAPTCHA ON — tokenless auth = `captcha_failed`).
- Privacy Policy + Terms at `#/legal/privacy` / `#/legal/terms`; footer links.
- `hello@itswellseasoned.com` forwards to owner Gmail via ImprovMX
  (MX/SPF records live on Vercel DNS).
- Analytics: first-party `events` table via `track()`; film/actor/actress
  leaderboards; showtimes; share cards; critic pipeline
  (`verify_critic` RPC, `kitchen_scores` view).
- Home shelves rotate per visit (`seededShuffle`/`HOME_SEED`, one seed per
  page load; sorted/canon shelves keep their order). Browse grid fixed 4-col
  (`.grid-cards`, steps 4→3→2). Tubi shelf shows 18.
- Coming Soon (`renderSoon`, `COMING_SOON` array): every upcoming film is
  clickable to a detail page (`renderSoonDetail`, routed via `cs-*` ids
  through `renderFilm`). "Let's Go / Meh" excitement vote shows ONLY on
  films with a trailer. Backed by `excitement_votes` table +
  `excitement_scores` view — RLS mirrors `person_votes` phase-2 exactly
  (all-roles read, insert/update require `user_id=auth.uid()`, owner delete);
  client fns `excitementVote`/`syncExcitement`/`loadAllExcitement`. Verified:
  forged user_id + bad stance rejected.
- Transfer (2025, dir. Paul D. Hannah, TMDB 1557378) added to catalog on
  Tubi with real pinned poster in `WS_POSTERS`; no fake score/votes.
- Featured spotlight carousel on the home page (`FEATURED` array →
  `paintFeatured`/`featSlideHTML`/`featGo`/`featSet`, auto-rotates, pinned
  backdrops for cinematic art, `.feat-car` CSS). Editorial pick of
  genuinely-current, prominently-Black titles (lead and/or creator suffices —
  owner's bar). Currently: Man of War (2026 film, LaMonica Garrett, dir.
  William Kaufman, real Apple TV deep link via per-film `f.watch` override),
  Survival of the Thickest (Netflix, S3 dropped 2026-07-02), All the Queen's
  Men (BET+, S5 dropped 2026-06-10). All real TMDB art/data, `k/t:null`,
  `votes:0`, no reviews — nothing fake.
- Search typeahead (`searchSuggest`/`searchKey`/`pickSuggest`, `#searchSuggest`
  dropdown): as you spell, prompts title matches (starts-with ranked first,
  then contains, then dir/cast), poster thumb + year·dir, arrow/enter to open,
  Enter-with-nothing runs the full Browse search. Desktop header only (search
  is hidden on mobile).
- Per-film where-to-watch deep links: optional `f.watch` map ({provider:url})
  overrides the generic provider-search `watchUrl()` when a title has a
  verified direct link (used for Man of War → Apple TV, since TMDB's
  watch/providers feed is empty for day-one VOD releases).
- Contributor sign-up portal in the footer (`.join-portal`, two lanes → The
  Kitchen for critics / The Word for writers). Both open a rich profile form
  (`openContribute(role)` → `doApply(role)`; `openApplyKitchen` kept as an
  alias): name/byline, email, **profile photo upload**, bio, outlet/beat,
  social media, work/site link. Photos upload to the public Supabase Storage
  bucket `contributor-media` (image-only, 5MB cap; insert policy `to
  authenticated` so silent-anon identities can upload, public read) via
  `contribPickAvatar`. Applications land in `critic_applications` with a
  `role` column (`critic`|`writer`) plus `bio`/`avatar_url`/`socials` columns —
  one editorial inbox, human review, nothing bought.

In progress:
- **Resend SMTP** for password-reset delivery. Client reset flow is already
  built (`forgotPassword` → `/recover` → `checkRecoveryHash`). Waiting on
  owner: create resend.com account, add domain, relay the DNS records
  (DKIM values are account-specific), add them in Vercel DNS, paste API key
  into Supabase → Auth → SMTP (host `smtp.resend.com`, port 465, user
  `resend`, sender `hello@itswellseasoned.com`). Then send a live test
  reset email end-to-end.

Open/backlog:
- Prerender/OG for crawlers (per-film share previews server-side).
- Data hygiene: a handful of pre-integrity test votes may remain.
- Vercel Web Analytics dashboard toggle (owner action).
- More real Tubi Black-culture titles to deepen the shelf (verify each vs
  TMDB — nothing fake).

## Monetization direction (decided 2026-07-03)
Owner rule: truest-to-brand, **no non-Black advertising**. That rules out
ad networks. Pursue, in order: (1) Membership — community-funded, zero ads,
uses the existing `#/join` page; needs Stripe (NOT authorized in this
session — hand the owner the key/setup steps). (2) Black-aligned brand
sponsorships — clearly-labeled "presented by" shelves. (3) Aggregate,
anonymized audience-sentiment data product for studios/distributors (the
real moat; privacy-safe, B2B, no consumer ads). Wishlist = My Plate +
streaming deep-links out; Trakt sync is the only real cross-device path
(later).

## Risk tiers for this repo
Stop and confirm with the owner first:
- Supabase migrations touching RLS/policies on votes, comments, profiles
  (a bad policy silently breaks ALL voting — it happened once via a
  read-policy scoped to `{anon}` only; fixed by `read_policies_all_roles`).
- Auth-flow changes (signup/signin/anonymous identity/captcha).
- Legal copy (`#/legal/*`), DNS records, anything spending money.
Proceed-then-report: UI/content changes, film-page rendering, styling,
docs. Every push deploys production — verify locally (headless Chromium,
`NODE_PATH=/opt/node22/lib/node_modules`, executable
`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) before pushing.

## Conventions
- After changing the FILMS catalog, regenerate crawler share data:
  `node scripts/build-films-json.cjs` (zero-dep; adds missing films to
  `api/films.json` + backfills posters, so every title has a `/f/<id>` preview).
- ES5 only in `index.html` (no arrow functions, template literals, let/const).
- Match the existing comment voice; comments explain constraints, not diffs.
- Test-harness gotcha: with Playwright routes, register the catch-all
  `**/rest/v1/**` FIRST and specific routes LAST (last registered wins).
- Git: develop on `claude/new-session-9aa459` only. The owner also edits
  from another machine (commits show as "Add files via upload"), so ALWAYS
  `git fetch origin claude/new-session-9aa459` and check you're not behind
  BEFORE editing or pushing — otherwise you clobber their work (or hit a
  non-fast-forward). Re-check right before every push.
